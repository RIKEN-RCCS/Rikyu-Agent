# AGENTS.md

Agent-facing notes for working in this repo. Read [`PORTING.md`](PORTING.md)
first — it's the general porting guide this repo was built from and isn't
duplicated here. This file covers what's specific to *this* port: design
rules to keep honoring, RIKYU's cluster facts, decisions made under
uncertainty, and the repo map.

## Design rules (from PORTING.md — do not violate)

1. **No write access to `hpc-agent-core`.** Every RIKYU-specific behavior
   lives in `server/rikyu_mcp/`, reached through `configure()` arguments,
   `SlurmBackend` constructor arguments, or — if nothing fits — a local
   equivalent that skips the `hpc_agent_core` module in question. If you
   think you need to edit the installed `hpc-agent-core` package, you've
   misunderstood something.
2. **Clarity over cleverness.** RIKYU is one of several machines built this
   way; a bit of RIKYU-specific duplication that reads clearly beats a
   generic abstraction that doesn't.
3. **The MCP server must never fail to start.** Nothing above module scope
   in `config.py`/`compute.py`/`hpc_server.py` touches the network or reads
   the config file eagerly. A missing/malformed config is a tool-call-time
   error ("run the configuring skill"), not a startup crash.
4. **Bias agent-created files into `~/agent/`.** `compute.py`'s
   `jobs_dir="agent/jobs"` already does this for job scripts; anything else
   this plugin creates on the cluster should follow the same bias unless
   the user gives an explicit path.
5. **Show before you run.** `submit_job` and `run_command_on_cluster`
   should be preceded by showing the user what's about to execute, unless
   they've explicitly said to just run it. This is enforced in the tools'
   docstrings (agent-facing instructions), not in code — there's no way to
   enforce "ask first" at the MCP protocol level.
6. **Never invent a documentation URL.** `docs_cite_url` is deliberately
   blank (see "Decisions made under uncertainty" below) — don't add one
   back into a skill or tool description.

## RIKYU cluster facts

Source: RIKYU's official user guide PDFs, originally fetched into `docs/`
(System Overview, Login, Slurm, Job Resources, Storage, Module Environment,
Spack, Welcome), read 2026-07-10. If RIKYU's documentation changes, re-read
the source and hand-edit `server/rikyu_mcp/data/rikyu_guide.md` and
`rikyu_config.json` — per PORTING.md §2, this repo deliberately never
auto-refetches a live site.

- **Scheduler**: Slurm, single partition `gpu`, 400 nodes, GPU vendor NVIDIA
  only. GPU request style is job-total (`--gpus=N`, never `--gres=gpu:N`);
  Slurm derives node count from the GPU count automatically (4 GPUs/node) —
  no job script example in the source docs ever sets `--nodes`. `--account`
  never appears in a job script either; treated as unused.
  `compute.py` uses `SlurmBackend(has_accounting=True, gpu_request_style="gpus_total")`
  — the plain first row of PORTING.md §6's table, and `hpc-agent-core`
  0.3.0's own `SlurmBackend` docstring names Rikyu explicitly as a verified
  `has_accounting=True` machine, so this wasn't a guess.
- **GPU counts**: only 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16 are accepted; `hpc_server.py`'s
  `submit_job` validates this before submission (`_validate_gpu_count`) so
  a bad count fails clearly instead of behaving unpredictably in Slurm.
- **Wall time**: flat 96-hour cap regardless of job size.
- **Storage**: home (`/home/USER`, 5 GB, Lustre, SSD-backed), group
  (`/data1/GROUP`, 1 TB, Lustre, HDD-backed), scratch (`/tmp`, 1.5 TB/GPU,
  xfs, node-local, wiped at job end).
- **Software**: Lmod modules for compiler/MPI toolchains (`nvhpc` and four
  variants); Spack (public instance at
  `/shared/software/spack-1.2.0/share/spack/setup-env.sh`) for applications.
- **Login**: `login.rikyu.r-ccs.riken.jp`; key registration via Open
  OnDemand's "SSH Public Key" app, not email-an-admin.

## Decisions made under uncertainty

This port was written without live SSH access to RIKYU — from its official
documentation only, per PORTING.md §1's instruction to prefer a real login
node smoke path when available, which wasn't available here. Two
consequences worth flagging to whoever runs PORTING.md §9's validation:

- **`has_accounting=True` is corroborated by `hpc-agent-core` itself**
  (its `SlurmBackend` docstring lists Rikyu by name as verified), so this
  is the one guess in this port with independent confirmation — still,
  confirm a real `sacct` call actually returns data before fully trusting
  job-history features, per PORTING.md §1's general caution about
  accounting being possible to have installed but disabled.
- **`docs_cite_url` was left blank deliberately**, not by default inertia.
  RIKYU's docs site (`docs.r-ccs.riken.jp/rikyu/en/`) is plausibly stable,
  but RIKYU itself is mid-Early-Access (through September 2026) and the
  site's long-term URL structure hasn't been observed to hold steady over
  time from here — PORTING.md §3's bar is "confident it'll still be there
  next month," which wasn't met. Revisit this once the machine (and its
  docs site) has been in production long enough to trust.
- **The Codex plugin manifest (`plugins/rikyu/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`,
  `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`) mirrors the Claude Code manifest
  shape by analogy** — no authoritative Codex plugin schema was available
  to verify against while writing this. Check it against Codex's actual
  plugin docs before relying on Codex-side installation; the Claude Code
  manifests (`.claude-plugin/`) are the ones built from an established
  pattern and are more trustworthy as written.
- **PORTING.md §9's real-job validation has not been run.** `doctor` and
  `tests/smoke.py` (including `--job`) need real SSH access to RIKYU to
  mean anything — see the repo's README for how to run them once that
  access exists. Passing these for the first time is the actual completion
  criterion for this port, not anything checked in so far.
